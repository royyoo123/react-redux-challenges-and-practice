## Student instructions

Welcome to the **React + Redux** track! Time for you to download exercises:

1. First fork this repository (to your personal GitHub account)
2. Open the terminal, and clone the repo.
3. Then add the `upstream` remote to update the exercises when needed.

Step 2 and 3 above can be done with:

```bash
cd ~/code/<github_nickname>
git clone git@github.com:<github_nickname>/react-redux-challenges.git
cd react-redux-challenges
git remote add upstream git@github.com:lewagon/react-redux-challenges.git
```

Be sure to replace `<github_nickname>` with yours ðŸ¤“

All good? Time to [dive in the first exercise, the Setup](https://github.com/lewagon/react-redux-challenges/blob/master/01-React/01-Tooling/01-Setup/README.md#setup)

## Update the exercises

If the teacher tells you that you don't have the latest exercise on your computer, run the following:

```bash
cd ~/code/<github_nickname>/react-redux-challenges
git status # Make sure it's clean! Commit stuff if necessary
git pull upstream master
```

You should now be good to go.
